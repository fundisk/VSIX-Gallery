# Disclamer 
**Gallery** is an work in progress project. It was create to fulfill a specific need and aimed to promote colaboration of a set of developers.
All contribuitions are welcome, we accept pull requests. :)



# VSIX Gallery (Codename not yet defined - Suggestions are gladly accepted :) )
Visual Studio SDK allow us to extend VS functionalities through plugins, extensions and templates, also allowing to distribute these extensions through:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com
- http://vsixgallery.com
- etc

However, sometimes in an organization we create template and extensions but they are internal to company and don't want to make them public.

**Gallery** is a web application (dotnet core) where we can host our own vsix extensions gallery, where it can be hosted on a private or public environment.
